## Obtain famland

Users have the following three channels to obtain famland:

> **Creating new famland** 
>
> Famland is an unlimited-issue NFT asset that users can obtain by creating famland for free. The newly created famland basically does not have much economic value, so users need to increase its economic value through long-term farming and merge operations.

> **Purchase famland**
>
> Users can purchase famland from other users from the YLE World NFT market. The YL needed to purchase famland can be exchanged for USDT through YLE Swap transaction.

> **Lease of famland**
>
> For players who have difficulty investing money, they do not need to invest in market-making capital and directly rent the famland publicly leased by the shared farmer. The lessor can obtain farming income in accordance with the revenue sharing rules of the contract.

## Join the farm

Famland must be added to YLE World's farms (including original farms and shared farms) in order to receive farming income. After the creation of new famland, it will automatically be added to the original farm by default. Different farms have different APY income returns. If users want to join a shared farm, they can first understand the requirements for joining the shared farm. After meeting the requirements, they can directly select the farm to join without the farmer’s approval.

## Famland farming

As long as you put USDT and YL of the same value in the basic field, original field or wild field at the same time, you can start to get the farming income YL.
