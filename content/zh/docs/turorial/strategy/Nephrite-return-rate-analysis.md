Since the collection cost of Nephrite is always increasing in each Rebase cycle, the price of Nephrite must be higher in the later stage. However, before the high APY shared farms appeared, did the early market price of Nephrite also have a certain value support?

For example, suppose that there are only 1,000 basic field in the initial period. At this time, Wild field's APY is 500%, then the basic field's APY is 1000%. The flow rate of the distribution pool is 1. The initial shared value is both 500. At this time, if there are 30 basic fields, use gray jade to merge the two basic fields into one basic field with a shared value of 700. A shared farm was constructed with these 30 basic fields.

According to the formula of diversion index and flow rate coefficient, this shared farm of 30 basic fields.

Shunt index=(700)*1=700

The total diversion index of the shared farm is 30*700=21000.

Assume that the total YL in the pool during this period is 1 million.

Let's take a look at the total diversion index of the original farm?

Shunt index = (500) * 1.032 (flow rate coefficient) = 516

The total diversion index of the primary farm is 970*516=500520.

Then, this shared farm of 30 basic fields accounted for 4.2% of the YL of the total pool, while originally they could only account for 3%. As a result, their actual APY has risen from 1000% to 1400%. Then, the daily income per 1 USDT has also increased from 0.027 to 0.038. A basic field of 500U will directly increase the income of 5.5U per day. This income always surpasses other basic fields of normal accumulated shared value. Here, even if the market value-added part of the early high share value famland is not considered, the value is roughly 5.5*365=2000YL if calculated based on the one-year direct income part.

Other costs of using Nephrite, such as the 500U market-making principal of the field that was destroyed, are 2000-500=1500YL. Calculated in this way, the value that can be created by a Grade 1 Nephrite should be around 1500 YL. The market price is 1000 YL, which should not be considered high. In the initial collection, one piece can be collected up to 20 consecutive times, and the highest collection cost is 600 YL. Under normal circumstances, it may be collected several times or more than ten times, and the cost is even lower. According to an 8-hour cycle, lessee can earn 400 YL a week by only the income of nephrite collecting.
